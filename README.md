# Least common Multiple

This is my solution to the assignment **LCM** of class **software developement 1**, written in Java.

More information can be seen in the comments of the source code.

A multiple of a number is the product of that number and an integer. For example, 10 is a multiple of 5 because 5 Ã— 2 = 10, so 10 is divisible by 5 and 2. Because 10 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 5 and 2, it is the least common multiple of 5 and 2.

Example: 

What is the LCM of 4 and 6?

Multiples of 4 are:

    4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, ...

and the multiples of 6 are:

    6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, ...

Common multiples of 4 and 6 are simply the numbers that are in both lists:

    12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, ....

So, from this list of the first few common multiples of the numbers 4 and 6, their least common multiple is 12.
